The purpose of this script is to visualize the dark abyss that is also known as GOTS8E3. This script will load a video file and capture one screenshot per second of video for analysis. It will then compute an average RGB value for each pixel and display this.

Will work out a control episode for comparison, and various averaging techniques.
